        <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
        <p>
          I recently graduated Galvanize’s full stack immersive program at the Boulder, Colorado campus mid July.
          Since graduation, I’ve been keeping self-disciplined with goal gating techniques to achieve weekly goals
          for programming, recreational outdoor sports and self improvement. Currently I’m making strides with my
          product Crush Routes under DownLink Design LLC, which I am also the co-owner of. It includes a RESTful
          API using NodeJS/PostgreSQL, a single page web application written in angular and a mobile application
          for Android/IOS devices using Apache-Cordova. My vision for the web component will be a social media/reddit
          clone; users will be able to interact with each other and view climbs around the world and, give a ratting
          and write a review. The mobile component will allow users to upload an image of a climb to AWS S3 from their
          location and find climbs. Eventually I will gamify the product to have a Pokemon Go resemblance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a passionate full-stack developer. While I am new to this field, I’ve been told by my instructors that my skill level in
          JavaScript is impressive for a junior level. Also, that my ability to learn other technologies such as Rails, Apache-Cordova,
          Sass and Gulp outside of the curriculum is unordinary for someone this early on. I don’t just love challenging myself with programming puzzles,
          I need it. I found that out about myself at my previous job while working for an environmental laboratory. I wasn’t being challenged enough and
          my quality of life suffered greatly because of this gap. I am really enjoying the process of life and exploring different opportunities,
          but programming is unprecedented.  Programming keeps me challenged constantly and brings me a lot of joy. I’ll be the first to admit that
          I don’t understand everything but I certainly have the drive and passion to learn quickly. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After reviewing the job description I believe my tool belt aligns closely with the job requirements. I am eager to learn new technologies and grow with a passionate team of developers.  I look forward to discussing my candidacy for the position.
          Thank you for taking the time to review my application.
        </p>

          Sincerely,
          Max Sturges

          Over the previous weekend I attended my brothers wedding, a part of the bridal party as a groomsman.
          My brother gifted all of his groomsman a pocket watch with a note to go along with it.
          Not to go into too much detail, the sentimental value of the watch was that we were a part of his
          life in the worst of times and now today, the best time of his life. This got me thinking about my
          own timeline and what time means to me. I didn’t have an epiphany of my philosophical understanding
          of time, rather reflected on my timeline and how my value of time has been shaped by my experiences.
          Time is precious, you can’t buy immortality, but you can make the best of every second.
        </p>

        <p>
          I strive to live a sustainable life style; always aiming to improve my life and the lives of those
          closest to me. While working towards a goal either alone or with others I try to make the best use of time.
          For the scope of this article I will not discuss in detail about what my goals are. However, goal gating is
          a powerful tool in my arsenal that I use to gage whether or not I’m making sustainable growth. From the start
          of the day to the end, I consciously and routinely question what it is that I am doing, and ask the question
          dose it align with my goals? If the answer is no, I drop what I am doing and strategically change gears to a
          task more aligned with my goals. Else, I keep doing what I’m doing.I’m going to power through this cliche, but
          my point is, if the goal is worth doing then you ought to do it right.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having healthy relationships with friends, fellow climbers and coders comes easily to me, but this wasn’t
          always the case. There are always two sides to every relationship and I only make the effort when I receive
          respect and see value in the relationship. In the past, not always but sometimes, I’ve made assumptions about
          what the other person is thinking about and spoke too early. This often lead to embarrassing moments and damaged
          relationships. However, this is a mentality that I’ve changed many years ago. I listen more now and ask questions
          when I do not understand. You can only have a healthy relationship if you understand, and to understand you must
          listen deeply and attentively. I believe only valuable and healthy relationships are worth keeping and the way to
          keep them is to be consciously aware of each other's emotions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many people have tattoos that they have attached their own meaning with.  For now I carry around my brothers
          pocket watch to remind myself of how precious every tick is. How I should never take any moment for granted,
          and strive to fill my life and those lives around me with joy.
        </p>
